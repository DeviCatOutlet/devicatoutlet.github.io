  My name is Rachelle, but most people know me as DeviCat. I’m a self taught digital illustrator and full time content creator.

The title "DeviCat" has a whole history to its creation. It started as a nickname for a cat character I had to animate for a school project. When I decided to start streaming on Twitch, I wanted a username that wasn't my real name, so I decided to use "DeviCat" instead as my pseudonym. To this day, some people still joke and think it means a "devil cat", others take it to a deeper meaning and refer to "Devi" as "goddess." Myself? I just think it sounds cute!

“I believe everyone has the potential to not only do something amazing, but the ability for compassion to themselves and those around them.” - DeviCat
