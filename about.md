## A Little Background Of Our Roots

I was given the opportunity to start streaming full time back in May of 2015
because of my husband HallwayRaptor. Back then I was going through major life
chapters; my dad had passed of cancer in March of 2014 and during this time
frame I found myself to be fighting symptoms of PTSD from past verbal abuse.
Originally, before I started on Twitch, my healing began with writing blogs on
this website, taking dance lessons, doing odd little jobs like house sitting,
and watching a lot of Day9TV (Mostly Walking), Markiplier, and ManlyBadAssHero
before I was introduced to the wonderful world of Twitch. And even when I began
doing this full time, I had no idea what I was doing. We started from the ground
up as a tiny variety channel, knowing no one, my husband working his day job to
help take care of us. And over the course of the past couple of years we’ve
moved provinces, got married, upgraded our equipment, improved our quality of
content, and over all evolved into a professional full time channel. Our
motivation comes from wanting to inspire others to work through their personal
obstacles by setting a positive example ourselves. 

To this day, HallwayRaptor now works alongside me at home to help manage this.
It’s a team effort, be it with Raptor and myself, our mods and this community.
We cannot thank you enough for these opportunities, and every day we are doing
our best to give back and pay your kindness forward.
