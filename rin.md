Rin is the fourth out of the four main original characters for the channel.
Not much is known of her yet as she is a fairly new and developed character.
Some could say she is from times of Devi’s life when she lost all trust with
people who were once friends. She is the symbol of judgement, the observer,
and is fearful of betrayal. She sticks very closely with her counterpart,
Reiko the fauna.
