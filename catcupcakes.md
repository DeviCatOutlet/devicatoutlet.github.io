# CatCupcakes

* **Name:** CatCupcakes (Berri, Punkin, Lemmy, Choco & Nilla)
* **Title:** Marching Cats
* **Personality:** Sarcastic Bliss, Smug, Excitement, Contentment, & Ignorance.
* **Symbol:** Cats / Cake
* **Representation / Inspiration:** Pure emotions.

There isnâ€™t a whole lot to be said about the catcupcakes as they are newly
developed characters of the channel. One could say they are the purest
representation of personality types that are not always appreciated. To this
day, only Nilla & Punkin currently have a human form.

The original concept in mind with the catcupcakes was to have ranks for viewers
of the channel. The more you watched the channel, the more your rank increased,
the further up the cake line you go. Over time when the Twitch channel started
to have things like custom cheers, Devi decided to incorporate the catcupcakes
further and to this day they have their own special alert..... 1000 bit cheer
