Due date to claim is by the 25th of the current month. If no form is filled, it will be deemed as not claimed for the month it was qualified. As such, please make sure your messages are enabled to be able to claim your gift! If you think you missed your message from Devi, please send an email with your Twitch username so she can send you your claim form. You will receive an email of confirmation from devicatoutlet@gmail.com when your gift is on its way, thank you gifts can take up to 2-4 weeks to arrive.</small>
