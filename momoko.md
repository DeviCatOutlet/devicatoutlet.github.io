Momoko is the first out of the four main original characters for the channel.
Originally named CutieCakeBot, the initial concept was to be a bot for the
channel that dispensed cakes as the currency for the viewers. This in mind,
Momoko didnâ€™t have a body or a personality at first. Over time, as the fan base
grew, viewers attempted at creating their own interpretations of her which
further inspired Devi to officially give her a body and then eventually a name.
