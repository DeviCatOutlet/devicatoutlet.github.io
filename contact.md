To anyone interested in sending something more than lettermail to our PO Box,
please take note of the following:

If Canadian taxes are not paid at the point of sale when the item crosses the
border into Canada, we will be charged COD (Collect On Delivery) to receive
the item. Therefore, we will have to refuse any gifts that incur COD.
