* Subscribing to either [DeviCat](https://go.twitch.tv/subs/devicat) or
  [HallwayRaptor](https://go.twitch.tv/subs/hallwayraptor).
* Upgrading your Twitch sub to a Tier 2 / Tier 3.

* Leaving a [tip](https://streamlabs.com/devicat).
* Leaving a [cheer](https://help.twitch.tv/customer/en/portal/articles/2449458).

All the things above help us to keep doing what we love most, which is being
able to stream full time and grow this channel and this community.

To anyone interested in sending something more than lettermail to our PO Box,
please take note of the following:

If Canadian taxes are not paid at the point of sale when the item crosses the
border into Canada, we will be charged COD (Collect On Delivery) to receive
the item. Therefore, we will have to refuse any gifts that incur COD.
