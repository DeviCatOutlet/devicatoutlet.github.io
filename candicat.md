CandiCat is DeviCat's mascot for her brand. She represents her Twitch subscriber emotes and comes in two forms! One version as a pink, purple and white cat! The other form being a kawaii magical anime girl. An introvert at heart, once she warms up to you, she shows all flavors of personality!

CandiCat is a space cat, an alien from outer space. One day she discovers Earth and that we have candy. But the only way for her to get sweets is by turning into a human (as no one takes a talking cat seriously.) And that's why a lot of the time she doesn't wear shoes. After all, she's a talking cat. She doesn't care about shoes, she just wants to eat (and we love her for that. â™¡)

Additional Lore: CandiCat is originally from Mirror Moon, where the civilians are known as "reflections." It's believed that CandiCats human form was her using her "reflect" ability based on the first person she met on Earth.
