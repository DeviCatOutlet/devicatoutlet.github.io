# Art Tips

These are personal experiences I have had from being a self taught artist and is written down here for you to help promote a healthy mentality of developing and strengthening your skills.

### Where should I start as a beginner?
When first starting out, the most important step is to START. It's very easy to come up with excuses, or to put it off. Just start with anything you have on you. Whatever equipement or tools despite how used or how old. As you start getting into the mindset of creating and you find what works for you, then you can take baby steps to upgrading your materials. Nothing is worse than sinking a ton of money into something that it turns out is not for you.

### How do I continue to develop and get better with my art?
A way to keep improving is this: with every new piece you want to create, have
a look at your last one. Take note of what you liked, now take note of what you
didn’t like. Of the things you didn’t like, make it your goal to improve on
that with your new piece.

### How can I stop myself from comparing myself to others?
Keep yourself in a positive mindset and only compare your current works to your
past works. Everyone has different levels of experience. What matters is your
own personal improvement over time.

### I’ve never used a tablet before, and the concept of looking up from where I’m drawing is difficult. Is there any way to make this process easier to grasp?
Learning to look at a monitor while your hand is drawing on your tablet can be a
challenge. I recommend an exercise called [blind contour drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_contour_drawing)
which will help strengthen hand / eye co-ordination.

### I need some words of wisdom, my spark of inspiration as an artist is dimming.
When you have 20 minutes of spare time, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plWexCID-kA)
from Neil Gaiman. This has saved me time and again as an artist and as a human being.
