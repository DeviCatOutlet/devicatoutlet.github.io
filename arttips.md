# Art Tips

These are personal experiences I have had from being a self taught artist and is written down here for you to help promote a healthy mentality of developing and strengthening your skills.

I personally recommend to start with [strengthening your foundations](http://drawabox.com/).
But it also never hurts to think of a short term goal and then taking a step
back to think about how you can achieve that goal realistically.

### *![✨](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/svg/2728.svg)* How do I continue to develop and get better with my art?
A way to keep improving is this: with every new piece you want to create, have
a look at your last one. Take note of what you liked, now take note of what you
didn’t like. Of the things you didn’t like, make it your goal to improve on
that with your new piece.

### *![✨](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/svg/2728.svg)* I always compare my art to others, everyone is so much better than me.
Keep yourself in a positive mindset and only compare your current works to your
past works. Everyone has different levels of experience. What matters is your
own personal improvement over time.

### *![✨](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/svg/2728.svg)* I’ve never used a tablet before, and the concept of looking up from where I’m drawing is difficult. Is there any way to make this process easier to grasp?
Learning to look at a monitor while your hand is drawing on your tablet can be a
challenge. I recommend an exercise called [blind contour drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_contour_drawing)
which will help strengthen hand / eye co-ordination.

### *![✨](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/svg/2728.svg)* I need some words of wisdom, my spark of inspiration as an artist is dimming.
When you have 20 minutes of spare time, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plWexCID-kA)
from Neil Gaiman. This has saved me time and again as an artist and as a human being.
